ðŸŒ† Building3D Urban Reconstruction Dataset ðŸŒ†

Overview

Welcome to my GitHub repository for the Building3D Challenge, a pioneering project focused on urban-scale building roof reconstruction using aerial LiDAR point clouds. This repository serves as the central hub for participants and researchers engaged in the challenge, offering tools and data for exploring advanced techniques in urban modeling.

The Building3D dataset spans 16 cities in Estonia, covering 998 kmÂ² and featuring over 160,000 buildings. It includes:

Mesh Models: Detailed 3D roof representations for realistic modeling.
LiDAR Point Clouds: Capturing urban environments with high accuracy.
Wireframe Models: Simplified 3D representations for efficient analysis.
This resource will support cutting-edge research and development in urban reconstruction, mesh simplification, point cloud completion, and semantic segmentation.

Dataset Access

Eligibility: Access is granted to users with educational or non-commercial accounts. Only university or company email addresses are eligible for prize awards. Free email providers (e.g., gmail.com, qq.com) are not accepted.

Testing: Participants must evaluate their methods using data from Tallinn City. Rankings will be determined based on WED scores.

Data Types

Building Point Clouds: Includes XYZ coordinates, RGB color, near-infrared data, intensity, and reflectance.
Roof Point Clouds: Focused specifically on roof structures.
Mesh Models: Created from LiDAR and building footprints using Terrasolid software.
Wireframe Models: Simplified representations consisting of vertices and edges.
