# ðŸŒ† Building3D Urban Reconstruction Dataset ðŸŒ†

## Overview

Welcome to my GitHub repository for the **Building3D Challenge**, an urban-scale building roof reconstruction project using aerial LiDAR point clouds. This repository supports participants and researchers in the challenge, providing key resources for advancing 3D urban modeling techniques.

The **Building3D** dataset covers **16 cities** in Estonia, spanning **998 kmÂ²** with over **160,000 buildings**. It offers:

- **Mesh Models**: High-detail 3D roof representations.
- **LiDAR Point Clouds**: Accurate real-world urban data.
- **Wireframe Models**: Simplified 3D structures for streamlined analysis.

This dataset is designed to accelerate research in urban reconstruction, mesh simplification, point cloud completion, and semantic segmentation.

## Dataset Access

**Eligibility**: Access is available to users with educational or non-commercial accounts. Only university or company emails are eligible for prize awards, with free email providers (e.g., gmail.com) not accepted.

**Testing**: Participants must test their methods using datasets from Tallinn City. Final rankings are determined by WED scores.

## Data Types

- **Building Point Clouds**: Includes XYZ coordinates, RGB color, near-infrared, intensity, and reflectance.
- **Roof Point Clouds**: Focused on roof structures, excluding facades.
- **Mesh Models**: Generated from LiDAR and building footprints, refined using Terrasolid software.
- **Wireframe Models**: Simplified 3D representations using vertices and edges.
