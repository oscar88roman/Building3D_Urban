# ðŸŒ† Building3D Urban Reconstruction Dataset ðŸŒ†

## Overview

Welcome to **Building3D**, an innovative dataset for urban-scale building roof modeling derived from aerial LiDAR point clouds. Spanning **16 cities** in Estonia and covering **998 kmÂ²**, Building3D features:

- **160,000+ Buildings**: Comprehensive coverage for extensive research.
- **Mesh Models**: Detailed 3D roof representations.
- **LiDAR Point Clouds**: Real-world data capturing the urban environment.
- **Wireframe Models**: New addition for simplified 3D representation.

We believe Building3D will significantly advance research in urban modeling, mesh simplification, point cloud completion, and semantic segmentation.

## Dataset Access

**Eligibility**: The dataset is available for download to users with educational or non-commercial accounts. Only university or company email addresses will be accepted for prize awards. Accounts with free email providers (e.g., gmail.com, qq.com) are not eligible.

**Testing**: Participants must test their methods on datasets from Tallinn City. Final rankings will be determined by WED.

## Data Types

- **Building Point Clouds**: Includes XYZ coordinates, RGB color, near-infrared information, intensity, and reflectance.
- **Roof Point Clouds**: Focuses solely on roof structures, excluding facades.
- **Mesh Models**: Generated from aerial LiDAR and building footprints, refined using Terrasolid software.
- **Wireframe Models**: Simplified 3D models consisting of vertices and edges.
